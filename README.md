## Acknowledgements
1. Apache Airflow:

Purpose: Orchestration of your data pipeline (DAG).
Documentation:
Apache Airflow Official Documentation
This is the primary resource for all things Airflow. It covers installation, configuration, DAG writing, operators, hooks, and more.
2. Apache Airflow Providers (Specific to your DAG):

airflow.providers.http:
Purpose: Provides the SimpleHttpOperator for making HTTP requests (to the NASA API).
Documentation:
Apache Airflow Providers HTTP
airflow.providers.postgres:
Purpose: Provides the PostgresHook for interacting with PostgreSQL databases.
Documentation:
Apache Airflow Providers Postgres
3. Python:

Purpose: The programming language used to define your DAG.
Documentation:
Python Official Documentation
Python is the foundation of Airflow DAGs. Familiarize yourself with Python syntax, data structures, and best practices.
4. PostgreSQL:

Purpose: The database where you're storing the NASA APOD data.
Documentation:
PostgreSQL Official Documentation
If you need to understand PostgreSQL SQL syntax, data types, or database administration, this is the definitive resource.
5. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):

Purpose: Used for data exchange between the NASA API and your DAG.
Documentation:
JSON.org
While not a formal "documentation" in the same sense as the others, JSON.org provides a clear and concise explanation of the JSON format.
Python has a built in Json library.
Python json library
6. Docker (Implicitly through Astro CLI):

Purpose: Containerization of your Airflow environment.
Documentation:
Docker Documentation
While you might not directly interact with Docker in the same way when using Astro CLI, understanding Docker concepts can be helpful for troubleshooting.
7. Astronomer Astro CLI:

Purpose: Tool for local Airflow development and deployment on the Astronomer platform.
Documentation:
Astronomer Documentation
This documentation will help with the proper use of the astro cli commands.
Key Concepts and Recommendations:

Airflow Operators and Hooks: Spend time understanding the different Airflow operators (like SimpleHttpOperator) and hooks (like PostgresHook). These are the building blocks of your DAGs.
Airflow Connections: Properly configuring connections is crucial for your DAG to interact with external systems.
DAG Development Best Practices: Follow Airflow best practices for writing maintainable and scalable DAGs.
Error Handling: Implement error handling in your DAG to gracefully handle failures.
